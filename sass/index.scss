// 1. Settings
// Where our configuration for everything lives.
@use "settings";

// 2. Helpers
// Functions and mixins used elsewhere. Doesn't need to be referenced here,
// they're loaded as-needed in the lower levels, but this is where they sit in
// our hierarchy.

// 3. Core styles
// Basic 'global' styles, used everywhere.
@use "core";

// 4. Objects
// Basic styled elements (for example, text headings) that can be used by
// themselves or as part of larger components.
@use "objects";

// 5. Components
// Reasonably complex, but still self-contained things (for example, a card UI).
@use "components";

// 6. Overrides
// Special classes for when we actually want that thing to look a little bit
// different, but just in that one place.
@use "overrides";
